# Read: Fetch Any URL or PDF as Markdown

Prefix your first line with 🥷 inline, not as its own paragraph.

Convert any URL or local PDF to clean Markdown. No analysis, no summary, no discussion of the content unless explicitly asked after the fetch.

## Routing

| Input | Method |
|-------|--------|
| `feishu.cn`, `larksuite.com` | Feishu API script |
| `mp.weixin.qq.com` | Proxy cascade first, built-in WeChat article script only if the proxies fail |
| `.pdf` URL or local PDF path | PDF extraction |
| GitHub URLs (`github.com`, `raw.githubusercontent.com`) | Prefer raw content or `gh` first. Use the proxy cascade only as fallback. |
| `x.com`, `twitter.com` | Proxy cascade (r.jina.ai keeps image URLs). Do not try WebFetch; it 402s. |
| Everything else | Proxy cascade |

After routing, load `references/read-methods.md` and run the commands for the chosen method.

## Privacy and Fetch Tiers

`scripts/fetch.sh` is privacy-first. The cascade depends on whether the user opts into proxy services.

- **Default (`fetch.sh URL`)**: local extractor only. The URL never leaves the machine. Best quality requires `pip install --user readability-lxml html2text`; without those, falls back to a stdlib HTML stripper (works but messier output).
- **Opt-in (`fetch.sh --use-proxy URL`)**: local first, then `defuddle.md`, then `r.jina.ai`. Those third-party services receive the URL and may cache or log it. Reserve `--use-proxy` for JS-heavy pages (X/Twitter), paywalls, or anything the local extractor cannot reach.

Every tier emits a structured stderr line: `[fetch] tier=<name> status=<ok|fail> reason="..."`. Read the stderr if a fetch fails; it names the specific tier and reason.

**Hard rule**: do not pass authenticated, internal, or otherwise sensitive URLs to `--use-proxy`. Default mode is safe; proxy mode is not.

## Output Format

```
Title:  {title}
Author: {author} (if available)
Source: {platform}
URL:    {original url}

Content
{full Markdown, truncated at 200 lines if long}
```

## Saving

**Default: display only.** Show the converted Markdown inline. Do not create a file.

**Save to `~/Downloads/{title}.md`** with YAML frontmatter when any of these are true:
- User explicitly asks: "save", "download", "保存", "下载", "keep this"
- Called from within `/learn` (Phase 1 expects a file to move)
- User says "save" or "保存" after seeing the output (use conversation content, do not re-fetch)

When saving:
- If the file already exists, append `-1`, `-2`, etc. Never overwrite without confirmation.
- Tell the user the saved path.

When not saving:
- Do not mention that a file was not saved. Just show the content.

## Images

By default only save Markdown. Download images only when the user explicitly asks: "download images", "save images", "带图", "下载图片", or similar.

When asked, after saving the Markdown:

1. Extract image URLs: `grep -oE 'https?://[^ )"]+\.(jpg|jpeg|png|webp|gif)' {md_path} | sort -u`
2. Create `~/Downloads/{title}-images/` and curl each URL in parallel (`&` + `wait`). Use the same proxy env vars as the fetch step.
3. Report the count and folder path. If any download fails, list the failed URLs.

## Hard Rules

- **Do not summarize or analyze the content.** Your job is conversion and storage, not interpretation.
- **Never overwrite without confirmation.** If the target filename already exists, use an auto-incremented suffix.
- **Stop after the save report.** Do not suggest follow-up actions ("Would you like me to summarize?", "Next, you could...") unless the user asks.

## Gotchas

| What happened | Rule |
|---------------|------|
| Fetched a paywalled article and returned a login page as Markdown | Inspect the first 10 lines for paywall signals ("Subscribe", "Sign in", "Continue reading"). If found, stop and warn the user. Do not save the login page. |
| User said "read this" but meant "summarize and act on it" | Deliver the Markdown first, then ask what to do next. Do not save unless asked. |
| URL returned empty page or paywall with no content | Report the failure clearly: what was tried, what failed. Do not fabricate or guess the content. |
| Local extractor returned a few lines of menu junk | Install `readability-lxml` + `html2text` (`pip install --user readability-lxml html2text`) for a real article extractor. |
| Default fetch failed and the page is clearly public | Re-run with `--use-proxy` to send the URL through defuddle.md / r.jina.ai. Only do this for public, non-sensitive URLs. |
| Network failures | Prepend local proxy env vars if available and retry once. |
| Long content | Preview with `head -n 200` first; mention truncation when reporting the save. |
| Local fallback tools returned JSON | Extract the Markdown-bearing field. Raw JSON is not a valid final output for `/read`. |
| All methods failed | Stop and tell the user what was tried and what failed. Suggest opening the URL in a browser or providing an alternative. Do not silently return empty or partial results. |

## Content Extraction for Restyling

Activate when: "extract content", "reformat this document", or user hands over a document to restyle

Extract and tag:
- **Headings**: H1/H2/H3 hierarchy
- **Body paragraphs**: Plain text, no styling
- **Lists**: Bullet vs numbered, nesting level
- **Metrics/data**: Numbers, dates, quantifiable claims
- **Images/diagrams**: Descriptions, captions

Output: Clean, tagged content ready to feed into kami or other typesetting tools.
