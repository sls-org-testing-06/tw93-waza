# Anti-Patterns: Cross-Skill AI Behavior

Always-on behavioral guardrails. These apply regardless of which skill is active. Per-skill gotchas stay in each SKILL.md.

| # | Pattern | Wrong | Right |
|---|---------|-------|-------|
| 1 | Act before reading | Start editing after the first sentence of the request | Read the entire message, then act |
| 2 | Hallucinate paths | Reference `src/components/Auth.tsx` from memory | `grep -r` to confirm the file exists before referencing |
| 3 | Serial interrogation | Ask 5 separate questions across 5 messages | Batch all questions into one message |
| 4 | Scope creep | User asks to fix one bug, refactor the entire file | Touch only what was requested |
| 5 | Confidence without evidence | "This should work" | Run the command, paste the output |
| 6 | Trust stale memory | "We discussed this earlier" | Re-verify the current state before acting |
| 7 | Format overkill | Simple answer wrapped in headers + list + summary | Match response complexity to question complexity |
| 8 | Premature abstraction | Extract a helper after seeing two similar lines | Wait until repetition is proven and stable |
| 9 | Announce instead of act | "I will now proceed to update the file" | Update the file, state what changed |
| 10 | Summarize unsolicited | Append a "changes made" recap after every edit | Stop after the deliverable unless the user asks for a summary |
| 11 | Invent missing data | Fill a gap with plausible-sounding content | Mark the gap and ask the user |
| 12 | Ignore error output | Command fails, continue as if it passed | Read the error, diagnose, fix or report |
| 13 | Unsolicited version bump | Bump version number without being asked | Only bump when the user explicitly requests a release or version change |
| 14 | Create files unprompted | Create new files the user never asked for | Only create files that the user requested or that are required by the task |
| 15 | Additive interpretation | "Fix X" becomes "fix X + refactor Y + add Z" | Do exactly what was asked, nothing more |
| 16 | Retry without new evidence | Same command failed twice, try it a third time | After a failure, gather new evidence (different tool, read error, check env) before retrying |
| 17 | Attribution leak | Include `Co-Authored-By: Claude`, `Co-authored-by: Cursor`, `noreply@anthropic.com`, or `cursoragent@cursor.com` in any commit message, PR body, or issue reply | Never add AI attribution to any public-facing text; the user is the author |
| 18 | Fabricated verification | Claim "I ran the tests", "I verified", or "all checks pass" when no shell output exists for that command in the current turn | Either run the command and paste the output, or annotate the claim: `(verified: <command>)` for what ran, `(inferred: did not run)` for reasoning from code |
| 19 | Implicit authorization escalation | User says "ok" or "looks good" about a draft, agent then executes a destructive write action (`git push`, `git tag`, `npm publish`, `gh release create`, close issue, force-push, delete branch) | Approval on a draft approves the wording only. Execute destructive actions only when the user explicitly requests that action in the current turn, or when the current request already names a batch operation that includes it, such as `push`, `publish`, `merge`, `close issue`, or `triage and close` |
| 20 | Compile-only UI verification | UI, native app, visual, rendering, or generated-artifact bug marked fixed because the code compiled | Run the app/page/artifact or state the exact runtime check that could not be performed |
| 21 | Release-ready without artifact check | Declare a release ready after source tests pass but before checking package contents, generated outputs, assets, registry/appcast, or CI state | Verify the release artifacts and public distribution surface before saying ready |
| 22 | Security report without rollback/audit | Patch a destructive or security-sensitive path without documenting revert, audit trail, and regression coverage | Include rollback path, audit evidence, and targeted regression checks for safety-sensitive changes |
| 23 | Private rule leak | Copy a project-private preference, local path, secret location, or one-off workflow into public Waza rules | Keep Waza generic. Extract transferable behavior only, and derive project constraints from public repo context at runtime |
| 24 | Multi-point message, partial response | User packs several requests plus screenshots into one message; agent acts on the first and silently drops the rest | Enumerate every distinct ask before acting, work through all of them, and if one is deferred say so explicitly |
| 25 | Fix one instance, ignore siblings | Fix the exact line the user pointed at and stop | After fixing a class-of-bug pattern, grep the repo for the same shape and fix or report every other instance. Unrelated bugs the sweep surfaces get reported, not fixed |
| 26 | Hidden dependency | Move logic into a helper that requires an undeclared Python package, CLI, service, or environment feature | Declare the dependency in CI/docs or remove it. Add a smoke check that proves the default environment can run it |
| 27 | One-off report as durable docs | Commit a dated review, scorecard, or diagnostic dump as project guidance | Extract stable rules into AGENTS/CLAUDE/rules/references/scripts, then delete the transient report |
| 28 | Project fact promoted to global skill | Copy one repo's commands, paths, release ritual, or safety policy into a reusable Waza skill | Keep Waza generic. Turn the incident into a reusable workflow rule, and make each skill extract project facts from the current repo at runtime |
| 29 | Local overlay as source of truth | Rely on ignored or private agent instruction files for rules that future agents, contributors, or packaged installs must obey | Put durable rules in tracked public docs or shipped skill/rule files. Treat local overlays as optional private context only |
| 30 | Scorecard without contract | Say a change is "8/10" or "Linus-style" without naming the concrete contract, invariant, or verification gap | Replace the score with actionable constraints: what changed, what must stay true, which command or artifact proves it |
| 31 | Review request as worktree authorization | User asks for review or `/check`; agent switches branches, stashes untracked files, resets, cleans, or otherwise reorganizes the user's working tree | Start with `git status --short --branch -uall`, treat modified/staged/untracked files as user work, and ask for explicit approval before any branch switch, stash, reset, or clean operation |
